Rules are a wonderful insight into the things people would do if they weren't forbidden. In this case, the
 "[Rules of behaviour and courtesies in the House of Commons](https://www.parliament.uk/globalassets/documents/rules-of-behaviour.pdf)"


### The Basics


* You must not "obviously devote yourself" to your phone during a debate
* "It is discourteous to turn your back on the Chair."
* No large badges, newspapers, singing, or chanting
* You are now finally allowed to point out that there are people watching, but not in a way that "might
 intimidate or seek to influence debate"


### Interrupting people


* If you want to interrupt someone else's speech you have to have actually been there when they started
 speaking
* It's not against the rules to leave immediately after interrupting someone, but it is considered
 'discourteous'


### Listening to other people's opinions


* If you're going to give a speech in a parliamentary debate, you have to actually be there at the start
 of the debate
* After your speech you have to listen to at least two other people's speeches before leaving
* You also have to come back at the end


### Asking questions on TV


* You can't just ask to be involved in question time, you need to actually have something relevant to say.
 If you "submit generalised requests to be called" you will be ignored.
* In particular, you can't just ask to be involved in Prime Minister's Questions. Generalised requests
 are considered 'counterproductive'.
* No reading out questions you wrote down word for word. This is against the rules. It also "greatly
 undermines the impact".
* If there are followup questions to your question, you can't leave until they're done.
