I'm a bit of a perfectionist about publishing, which makes it hard for me to put up explanations or discussions. But if I 80/20 why I want to put up posts at all, a lot of it is about just flagging specific ideas I like. So here is the 80/20 post: a bunch of takes. Maybe one day they'll turn into posts!

### On the future of the world
- AI is going to be the most major thing, most comparable to an industrial revolution or the spread of the internet
  - Incredible gains
  - Fundamental restructuring of society and social dynamics, often in pretty harmful ways
  - Essentially impossible to reverse
- The impending population crisis is going to suck
  - The modern economy is built on consistent expected growth, and fewer people means less growth
  - The fact that this isn't a super mainstream concern should tell you something about 'how politics actually works'

### On society
- Modern society is much more atomic than it used to be
  - Overly simplified example: we have care homes for old people and nurseries for children, both of which are possibly kind of toxic, instead of a culture where the elderly are secondary care givers
  - A lot of why dating apps suck is that you don't have mutual friends with a potential partner (who could eg/ provide social proof, mediate conflicts, discretely move information)
  - There used to be lots of accessible community spaces like youth centres, churches, and local pubs, which provided people with emotional support, accountability, and social connections including relationships
  - People used to basically work with the same company for life, now it's standard to bounce every couple of years
  - __This is an oversimplification and not the whole picture, but it is part, and it's pretty striking__
- We really need something like a land tax
  - More generally, the UK is in dire need of housing reform
  - Fundamentally land is an asset with a fixed supply and ever-increasing demand, so if you corner the market you can really easily gouge people
  - A tax on the unimproved value of land doesn't distort incentives in the way that eg/ an income tax lowers the incentive to work

### Unannotated list of things I am bullish on
- Bayesian epistemology
- 1:1 mastery learning
- Active inference
- The intelligent social web
- Shadow work
