title: "Ethics or lack thereof"

Something like four months ago I had this weird revelation that maybe all of ethics was bunk. I've had a couple
 moments like this in my life and most haven't stuck; I assumed this one also wouldn't. But, well, it's been a
 few months and I still think maybe ethics is fake. And weirdly I think it's made it easier for me to care about
 things, and do things that I think matter.


Why I changed my mind
---------------------


I used to basically want two things from ethics. The first was to know what to do, because wow, the world is very
 confusing, and I often find myself in tricky situations where I really wish there was a good answer. Call this
 **action-guiding**. The second was to do good, to be a good person who did good things and cared
 about stuff. Call this **goodness**. I now believe neither of these is a good reason.


Action Guiding
--------------


I don't think any ethics is action-guiding. I spent a few years doing moral empiricism - actually
 trying to be a stoic, an existentialist, a daoist, a virtue ethicist, even very briefly a kantian - and they're
 all terrible at telling you what to do. 


I came across the action guiding objection in the context of virtue ethics, and it's true: "be wise and
 temperate" really isn't an algorithm for making choices. But none of the others are better! I read the Ethics
 of Ambiguity and internalised the fact that it's actually pretty hard to abstract the morally relevant details
 from a situation. Yeah, once you have the maxim, you can run Kant's test on it at least sometimes, but pulling
 out the morally relevant details of a situation is hard!


Even consequentialism isn't *really* action-guiding, because utility calculations are debilitatingly hard.
 It would be a great moral system for someone omniscient, but our hardware is basically terrible for everything
 except virtue ethics.


So, crux 1: No ethical system is actually action-guiding. 


(mumble mumble "what should we do" is not the same as "how should we decide what to do", yeah, sure, but
 unless we can solve the second one, the first is sort of irrelevant, and I have yet to see anyone get from A to
 B).


Goodness
--------


There's this argument that swirls around sometimes in various shapes. One version is this: "Whenever you make a
 choice, you are picking the thing you most want to do, so you are choosing based on your own desires, so the
 choice is fundamentally selfish. Even if you throw yourself in front of a train to save a stranger's baby, it is
 essentially still you doing the thing you want to do, so there is in fact no such thing as altruism".


I think this is just wrong.


The very brief explanation of why is "it seems genuinely simpler to describe people as actually caring about the
 outside world". Notably you don't lose any predictive power. On the other hand, the "secretly selfish"
 argument needs a whole bunch of epicycles. More specifically, I think most of the time people make these
 arguments, it's coming from some kind of place of confusion.


A longer and better version of this argument shows up in [replacing guilt](https://mindingourway.com/the-stamp-collector/). Personally, I first encountered
 it at a 9am philosophy lecture in my first year of undergrad. I remember it because it's one of about four times
 in my whole degree where a philosophy tutor spent half an hour making an argument that genuinely permanently
 shifted my worldview. Big thumbs up.


Weirdly, though, the version I managed to cache was the weird mid-2010s internet atheist dialectic where the
 theist goes "but if there was no god, wouldn't people just start murdering each other on the streets?" and the
 atheist goes "what the heck are you talking about?"


So what
-------


So you don't need ethics to care about stuff and want to do good things. And ethics isn't actually going to help
 you work out what to do about the things you think matter. To the extent that it even could, you'd be treating
 it not as an ethical system but as a decision-making procedure.


And these are great! Virtue ethics is a pretty good heuristic for daily life; rule consequentialism is a
 reasonable heuristic for massive confusing decisions under heavy uncertaintly; stoicism is a great way to deal
 with bad feelings. But I'm pretty sure none of them are actually real.
