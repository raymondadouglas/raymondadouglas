title: "10 things I hate about The Harmonica"
date: 2022-02-03
---



1. A given harmonica can only play in one key
2. And only about five chords
3. Whichever key it plays a major scale in, it plays the blues in a different key
4. Doing the soulful wailing thing makes it go out of tune
5. You tune it by shaving off tiny pieces of metal
6. But first you have to open it with a tiny screwdriver
7. Also sometimes notes just stop working; again you must open it
8. Whatever Bob Dylan was doing with a harmonica, it was not meant for that
9. If you play it after drinking something sweet and sticky you'll ruin it
10. I have been stopped at airport security twice now for having a suspicious object in my bag
