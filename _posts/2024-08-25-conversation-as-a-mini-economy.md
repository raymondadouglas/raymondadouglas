*tldr: the movement of large conversations is a bit like trades in a market, where speech is an implicit bid on the value of what you're saying*

*If you already find group conversation easy and comfortable then this post will be at best an interesting novelty. But somehow I keep meeting people who are much better at intuiting economics than at intuiting how to participate in large groups.*

### What's up with big conversations

Here  are some behaviours you might have observed in big groups and been baffled by:
- Some people get talked over, and other people don't
- Some people get to make long speeches
- Some people make points that then get completely ignored, while others make points that redirect the conversation, that other people try to build on

This is obviously partly to do with what's being said in the moment, but also not entirely. It can seem like over the course of a conversation, some people get shut out. Why?

### The basic mechanism
I think what's going on is that over the course of the conversation, the group is collectively keeping a kind of scorecard for how good people's contributions are.

You start off with some number of credits, for outside reasons like what the context is or how you joined the conversation - basically people's rough estimate of how good your contributions will be.

Then, whenever you try to speak, you are implicitly gambling some of those credits on this contribution being valuable. The longer you talk, the more credits you're burning. But if the contribution actually is valuable, you get more credits back.

If you run out of credits, that's when people start talking over you, or just not listening very hard to what you're saying. Once you get lots of credits, that's when you start getting to make big speeches.

This is basically a good system. It's a good way to make sure that conversational time gets spent on valuable things, in a fairly distributed way. The downsides are:
- It is pretty unpleasant being talked over and ignored
- Sometimes you start making a point which would be valuable if you could finish, or if people took it seriously, but you're too low on credit to actually make the gamble, which can feel really unfair
- Not everyone knows how to play the game, and if they don't, they contribute less

I claim that in practice, this last point covers all the above points. Once you know how to play the game, you can just be a bit more strategic, and then you won't get talked over, and you won't make long points until you have enough credit banked.

### Conflicts
Most of the time, I don't think people are actually trying to be dicks. Taking the most charitable lens, I think things like interrupting and ignoring should be viewed as prosocial behaviour - trying to make sure the conversation goes in a good direction.

It is also a risk: if you interrupt someone who was saying something that you thought was pointless, but then they interrupt back, keep talking, and say something that the group agrees was valuable, then you lose a lot of credit.

Analogously, when Person A tries to open a line of conversation, Person B's contribution to that line is a form of investment. If Person B's contribution leads somewhere good, both people get credit for it.

In fact, Person B can invest in many different ways:
- Riffing on the point
- Asking good questions that help Person A develop the point
- Clarifying Person A's point to the group
- Just asking Person A to keep talking

Much like the real economy, conversations are not a series of narrow trades where some people lose and others profit. Conflict is still an important mechanism, for the same reason that efficient markets include a lot of shorting.

## Sensible investment in conversation
So what should you actually do with all this? How should you approach large group conversations with all this in mind? Here are some thoughts:
- **Start small**: test the waters with little contributions and see how they go down
- **Be prosocial**: try to figure out what's good for the conversation, and other people, as well as what you want to say
- **Invest in others**: ask good questions, help clarify the contributions of others, and you will not only create value but also earn allies

The above strategy is, I believe, generally better than both saying whatever comes into your mind and never saying anything, especially for anyone who's more comfortable with economics than large groups.

### (Bonus: Why groups suck at making decisions)

Groups are often weirdly bad at coming to agreements about what to do, where to eat, and so on: in fact, some people really resist even making suggestions or advocating for actually doing anything.

Why? Because people are concave optimisers! Making a decision for the group is a really large bet. Sure, you'd get a lot of credit if you could pick a movie everyone wanted to watch, but do you really want that much credit?

Even if you're pretty confident, making a choice for a large group requires staking a lot, and most people would prefer many small investments. It's just the prudent choice (for an individual, at least).
