## Elsewhere on the internet

### Some papers

You can find me on [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RcAqOJQAAAAJ&hl=en) although my profile is not indexed, because I have no institutional affiliation.

### Other bits of writing

I have a smattering of LessWrong posts: the two I would recommend are [this conceptual puzzling over agency](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jpGHShgevmmTqXHy5/decomposing-agency-capabilities-without-desires) and [this very short piece](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vdzEpiYX4aRqtpPSt/the-opt-out-clause).

### Other places

I have a [github](https://www.github.com/raymondadouglas) but all the repos are private except for this site itself. If you're really committed, you can snoop on my drafts.

I sometimes write scripts for youtube videos, like this [explanation of mechanistic interpretability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGCvY4gNnA8)

### Social Media

Other than messaging services I don't use social media, although sadly I do have a linkedin. From time to time I make a burner twitter account.

There's also a very defunct facebook where you might be able to find most of the extant recordings of me before my voice broke. It's a strange thing to grow up on platforms that cycle in and out of use.
