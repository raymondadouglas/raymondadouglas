## Elsewhere on the internet

### Bits of writing

I have a smattering of LessWrong posts: the two I would recommend are [this scrappy attempt at ML research](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hmPCPyr6JFLEigHJx/goal-direction-for-simulated-agents) and [this](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vdzEpiYX4aRqtpPSt/the-opt-out-clause).

### Other places

I have a [github](github.com/raymondadouglas) but all the repos are private except for this site itself

### Social Media

Other than messaging services I don't use other social media, although sadly I do have a linkedin.

There's also a very defunct facebook where you'll find a post I made in secondary school that somehow got tens of thousands of comments, and some videos of me before my voice broke. It's a strange thing to grow up on platforms that cycle in and out of use.
