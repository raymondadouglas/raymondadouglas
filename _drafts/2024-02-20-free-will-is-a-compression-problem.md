I broadly think it is often reasonable to prevent people from saying thtings publicly, even if what they're saying is true.

I have two strong intuitions:
- People should be able to seek the truth
- Some things should not be uttered in public

Reconciling these is surprisingly hard. 


How could it ever be wrong to speak the truth? Well, I think the truth is often very complex, and sometimes you don't have that much bandwidth. So in practice what you have to do is compress that messy truth into a tweet, or a catchy phrase, or concepts that make sense to children.

The problem is that this compression is very lossy. There are far more possible novels of 60,000 words than there are summaries of 500 characters. If we imagine for a second that there is some natural way to infer the novel-length version of someone's opinion from the sentence-length version, then most of the time that inference will go wrong. Sometimes very wrong.
