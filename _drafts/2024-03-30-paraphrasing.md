- A friend describes his painful relationship with his parents. In response, you echo his description back in your own words, reassuring him that you were listening carefully.

## Why it's hard to do:
- It's time-consuming
- Being wrong is aversive

## Why it's hard to ask for:
- It's a big ask
- It's tempting to fake
