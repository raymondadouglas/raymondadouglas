The hard bit about laying this out is that these are all essentially interspersed:
- The symmetry between information and capacity for work recurs in entropy, markets, and predictive processing
- Optimisation problems appear in agents and in markets, and are best understood in terms of causality

Information theory
- Thermodynamics
- KL Divergence everywhere
- Causal emergence
- Map/territory distinctions

On thermodynamics specifically, the notion of unavoidable rot, and the deep symmetry between information and capacity for work, which is often lost in discussions of agency

Probability
- Law of large numbers
- Central limit theorem

Markets
- Expected value and variance
- Reflexivity
- Efficient Market Hypothesis
- Veblen Goods and Conspicuous Consumption

Optimisation problems
- Goodhart's Law
- Collider Bias

Causality
- 

Predictive structure of agency
- Decision transformers
- The intelligent social web / archetype theory
