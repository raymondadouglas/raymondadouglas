I'm pretty into travelling the world, and I've had quite a few chances to test and refine my approach. The two things I've got pretty good at are __staying comfortable__ and __packing light__. 

## On staying comfortable

First and foremost, you want to keep your basic needs met through the arduous process of travel. This means:
- Food, ideally something calorie-dense and long-lasting like hiking bars and trail mix.
- Clothes you can easily add and subtract (which means lightweight), which will keep you comfortable, safe from weather, and the right temperature. For instance, thermal layers, loose trousers, a shirt you can button up or down, and a packable rain jacket.
- The ability to sleep despite adversity: good earplugs (also good for planes taking off and loud boats!), an eye mask (get the padded kind that doesn't sit on your eyes), and some melatonin if you can get hold of it.

Basically, you want to make sure that over the course of your travel, and while you're getting settled into a new place, you're not taking damage from the absolute basics of human survival. You shouldn't be starving, freezing, boiling, soaked, or unable to sleep. 

Other than food, all of this stuff is reusable: it's an upfront cost to avoid ever being pushed to the extremes of discomfort.

I usually don't check bags if I can help it
